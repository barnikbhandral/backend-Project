## dev dependencies using -D 
dependencies needed for the development not at the time for production ex. nodemon
if we do not use -D we install it as normal dependency

## "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
 so that we can start server using nodemon --- npm start dev


## install prettier as a dev dependency
    make a folder .prettierrc and set up rules for prettier
    make .prettierignore to ignore files that does not need prettier eg .env file
